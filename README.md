# Nexmo Rap God
### Royal Hackaway 2019

Using the Nexmo API, we got the user to text a phone number with the theme they'd like to use for their own rap. Then, a random song is picked from our short list of songs, which then is modified to their theme.

The result is then sent back to the user. This is done with a phone call, where the rap is sung back to them.
